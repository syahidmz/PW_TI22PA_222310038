    <h1>The 10 Most Popular Programming Languages to Learn in 2022</h1>
    <p>There’s no question that software programming is a hot career right now. The U.S. 
        <b style="color: red;">Bureau of Labor Statistics</b> projects 21 percent growth for programming jobs from 
        2018 to 2028, which is more than four times the average for all occupations. What’s 
        more, the median annual pay for a software programmer is about $106,000, which 
        is nearly three times the median pay for all U.S. workers.</p>
        <p>Not all programming jobs are the same, however. Different roles, companies, 
            and types of software require knowing and understanding different 
            programming languages—and it’s often beneficial to know multiple 
            languages. Trying to break into the field of software programming can be a 
            daunting experience, especially for professionals with no prior programming 
            experience.</p>
        <p>The <b style="color:aquamarine;">Master of Science in Computer Science Align program</b> at Northeastern 
        University is specifically designed for students who want to transition into 
        computer science from another field of study.

        and have them come out as software engineers,” says Ian Gorton, PhD and</p>
        <p><i>“Our aim is to transport students from a variety of different backgrounds 
            and have them come out as software engineers,”</i> says Ian Gorton, PhD and director of the graduate computer science programs at Northeastern 
            University—Seattle. <i> “We focus on math, programming, and a variety of computer science and engineering concepts.”</i></p>
        <p>Whether you’re new to programming or looking to brush up on your skills, it 
            helps to know which languages are in high demand. Here are 10 of the most 
            popular programming languages of 2020 based on the number of job postings 
            listed on job search sites Indeed, the average annual salary for those jobs, and 
            factors such as ease of use and potential for growth.
